Moreover, it can predict long-term risk for cardiovascular events. A lowHeart Rate is common for people who exercise frequently and participate in athletics. Tracking Heart Rate can provide insight into fitness levels, heart health, and emotionalhealth. Moreover, for individuals taking medication for cardiovascular conditions, daily HeartRate measurements can assist the doctor in advising on the proper course oftreatment.
